James, a spirited young man who uses a wheelchair, loves attending art workshops and visiting the local community center. With the support of our dedicated NDIS worker Sarah, he’s not just participating — he’s thriving. At Helping Hands, we believe in more than just assistance.

Surrounded by blooming flowers and birdsong, she chats happily with her support worker who walks beside her. Living with a physical disability once limited her time outdoors — but with the care and encouragement from our Helping Hands team, Amira now feels confident, independent, and connected to the world around her. These are the moments that remind us why we do what we do.</p>
